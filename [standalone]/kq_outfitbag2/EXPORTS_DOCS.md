# Script exports

## Opening a "Fixed" bag using an export
On the client side, you may execute the `OpenFixedBag` export

```lua
-- Example
exports['kq_outfitbag2']:OpenFixedBag('bagName')
```

This will open the fixed bag, with its outfits. The outfits are to be defined in the `config.lua` of `kq_outfitbag2`
