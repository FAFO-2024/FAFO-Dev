# Redneck Lighting Controller

This is the official Redneck Mods Lighting Controller used on all new Redneck Modifications vehicles to enhance your lighting experience and easily control the extras to make it feel more realistic.

# Important Notice

For the stage lighting to work on any compatible vehicles, you MUST have the LVC edit linked below installed in your server.
Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, but it is the only way to get the stage working to work smoothly at the current time.
