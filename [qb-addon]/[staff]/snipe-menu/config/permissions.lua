    All the roles here can access the admin menu
    Only the GOD can set the panels for the other roles
    There are 3 options
    1. God -> can access all the commands
    
    IMPORTANT: DO NOT REMOVE GOD ROLE, IF YOU DO SO, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE ADMIN MENU AT ALL

    If you have a new role, you can add it here and select to give either God, Admin or Moderator or any of the custom perms you want

    eg. ["new_role"] = "God",
    eg. ["dev"] = "Admin",
